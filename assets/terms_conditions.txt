Last Updated: [Your Date Here]

1. Introduction
Welcome to QuadSmart, where we blend the joy of four wheels with the thrill of two! By using our app, you're agreeing to these ridiculously entertaining Terms of Service (TOS). If you don't agree, you'll miss out on some fantastic, fun-filled rides.

2. Eligibility for Riding
2.1. Age: You must be old enough to reach the pedals and young enough at heart to appreciate a good chuckle.
2.2. Skills: The ability to ride a bike while chuckling is preferred but not mandatory.

3. Account Registration
When registering, pick a username that sparks joy - something like "GigglingRider" or "QuadComedian." Gloomy usernames are frowned upon here!

4. Bike Usage
4.1. Our QuadSmart bikes are equipped with a "giggle-gear." The more you giggle, the smoother the ride.
4.2. Juggling while riding is not advised, but if you're a pro, we'll pretend we didn't see it.

5. Payments and Fees
5.1. Standard rental fees apply, but if you share a rib-tickling joke, you might unlock a surprise discount.

6.2. Please refrain from feeding the bikes; they're strictly on a laughter diet.

7. Prohibited Activities
7.1. Wearing a long face while riding is prohibited.
7.2. Racing turtles is not allowed; they're sensitive about their speed.

8. Maintenance and Damage
If your bike starts giggling along with you, it's in peak condition. If it's too quiet, contact us, and we'll send our comedic mechanic.

9. Termination of Service
We reserve the right to discontinue service if you're excessively serious. QuadSmart is all about the fun.

10. Changes to Terms of Service
We may revise these terms to include more puns and jokes.
