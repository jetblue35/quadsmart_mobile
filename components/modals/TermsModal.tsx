Terms of Service for QuadSmart: Empower Your Journey Bike Rental App

Last Updated: 21.01.2024

1. Introduction
Welcome to QuadSmart, where we blend the joy of four wheels with the thrill of two! By using our app, you're agreeing to these ridiculously entertaining Terms of Service (TOS). If you don't agree, you'll miss out on some fantastic, fun-filled rides.

2. Eligibility for Riding
2.1. Age: You must be old enough to reach the pedals and young enough at heart to appreciate a good chuckle.
2.2. Skills: The ability to ride a bike while chuckling is preferred but not mandatory.

3. Account Registration
When registering, pick a username that sparks joy - something like "GigglingRider" or "QuadComedian." Gloomy usernames are frowned upon here!

4. Bike Usage
4.1. Our QuadSmart bikes are equipped with a "giggle-gear." The more you giggle, the smoother the ride.
4.2. Juggling while riding is not advised, but if you're a pro, we'll pretend we didn't see it.

5. Payments and Fees
5.1. Standard rental fees apply, but if you share a rib-tickling joke, you might unlock a surprise discount.
5.2. Late return fees come with a frown, especially if you don't bring the bike back smiling.

6. Safety and Responsibilities

6.2. Please refrain from feeding the bikes; they're strictly on a laughter diet.

7. Prohibited Activities

7.2. Racing turtles is not allowed; they're sensitive about their speed.

If your bike starts giggling along with you, it's in peak condition. If it's too quiet, contact us, and we'll send our comedic mechanic.

9. Termination of Service
We reserve the right to discontinue service if you're excessively serious. QuadSmart is all about the fun.

10. Changes to Terms of Service
We may revise these terms to include more puns and jokes.

11. Contact Information

The SparkRentals app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide our Service. It‚Äôs your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure.

The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but SparkRentals AB cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don‚Äôt have access to Wi-Fi, and you don‚Äôt have any of your data allowance left.

If you‚Äôre using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you‚Äôre accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming.

Along the same lines, SparkRentals AB cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged ‚Äì if it runs out of battery and you can‚Äôt turn it on to avail the Service, SparkRentals AB cannot accept responsibility.

With respect to SparkRentals AB‚Äôs responsibility for your use of the app, when you‚Äôre using the app, it‚Äôs important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. SparkRentals AB accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.

At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android & iOS ‚Äì the requirements for the both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you‚Äôll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. SparkRentals AB does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android & iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
